<h1>Static files in production</h1>

<p>
You would do it exactly the same way, except you won't be running <code>./manage.py runserver</code> anymore.</p>

<p>This means <strong>your static files will NOT be discovered automatically : they must be served by a production ready server</strong> such as Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd or a CDN.</p>

<p>Since this is not a tutorial, I will not go into details on how you can do each, but only the most common way.</p>

<h2>Put all static files in the same dir</h2>

<p>The classic configuration is to have <code>settings.STATIC_ROOT</code> pointing to a directory where Django should copy all static files.</p>

<p>Then you run <code>./manage.py collectstatic</code>.</p>

<p>It will copy them all in there.</p>

<p><strong>Try it.</strong> Run the command, then look at the files in <code>settings.STATIC_ROOT</code> (currently : <em>{{ settings.STATIC_ROOT }}</em>).</p>

<p>There will be a lot of files in there : all files from all 'static' directories from all apps are copied automatically, including the numerous CSS/JS files of the Django 'admin' app.</p>

<h2>Serve static files</h2>

<p>It will be then your job to create a configuration file for your server so it serves the content of <code>settings.STATIC_ROOT</code> when a request is made to <code>settings.STATIC_URL</code> (currently : <em>{{ settings.STATIC_URL }}</em>)</p>

<p>I like to use Nginx to serve Django apps. Here is what a minimalist Nginx configuration file could look like :</p>

<pre>
server {
    listen      80;

    # Serving static files.
    # If the server ask for http://site.com/static/anything, it will
    # match this and servce 'anything' from the directory containing
    # all static files.
    # Django is never called for these files.
    location ~* ^{{ settings.STATIC_URL }} {
        root  {{ settings.STATIC_ROOT }};
    }

    # Passing other requests to Django. Not the topic of this app :-)
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    }
}

</pre>

<p>A similar Apache configuration file would be:</p>

<pre>
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;

    # Serving static files.
    # If the server ask for http://site.com/static/anything, it will
    # match this and servce 'anything' from the directory containing
    # all static files.
    # Apache doesn't like the leading slash on aliases, so don't do
    # "{{ STRIPPED_STATIC_URL }}/"
    Alias {{ STRIPPED_STATIC_URL }} {{ settings.STATIC_ROOT }}

    &lt;Directory {{ settings.STATIC_ROOT }}&gt;
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;

    # Passing other requests to Django. Not the topic of this app :-)
    WSGIScriptAlias / {{ settings.PROJECT_DIR }}/wsgi.py

    &lt;Directory {{ settings.PROJECT_DIR }}&gt;
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    &lt;/Directory&gt;

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you don't have access to Apache configuration but can set rewrite rules in a .httpacess files, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre>AddHandler fcgid-script .fcgi
RewriteEngine On
# Be careful with this, settings.STATIC_URL should match any subpath
# of /path/to/apache/root/dir/ since we don't serve it, we REWRITE it.
RewriteRule {{ settings.STATIC_URL }} /path/to/apache/root/dir/{{ STRIPPED_STATIC_URL }}
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ site.fcgi/$1 [QSA,L]</pre>

<p>I wrote the paths using template variables, but in the real file, they are hard coded. This is why it's common to generated configuration files using template files.</p>
